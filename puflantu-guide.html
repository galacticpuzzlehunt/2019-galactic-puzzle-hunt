    <p>Teams that solve the The Artifact meta begin to receive artifacts written in Perflontus (puflantu), which is used
        in
        the four main round metas as well as the metameta. The artifacts are intended to give teams known or deducible
        texts
        against which to begin learning how to translate Perflontus. What follows is a summary of language features,
        starting from the most basic. For puflantu vocabulary, see <a href="https://github.com/galacticpuzzlehunt/puflantu">here</a>.</p>
    <p>For the remainder of this write-up, and in other write-ups where it becomes relevant, Perflontus text will be
        written
        in <span class="puflantu">monospace</span>.</p>
    <p class="design-notes">Design notes: Perflontus takes a lot of design cues from Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and
        Spanish
        (in some order), along with a few etymological decisions from Russian. I felt that German would seep a bit into
        the
        language regardless of what we wanted through its relationship with English. I tried to refer to the Asian
        languages, both because two of them are SOV and because I wanted to give native English speakers a little less
        of a
        "home" advantage in picking up Puflantu.</p>
    <h3>Mouth Sounds and Word Composition</h3>
    <p>Perflontus uses the English alphabet plus apostrophe (henceforth <span class="puflantu">'</span>). Most of the
        sounds are what a
        Spanish speaker would expect them to be. More details are available in the Artists meta solution.</p>
    <p>Syllables in Perflontus are always contain a single vowel, which may be preceded by up to one consonant and
        followed
        by up to one consonant. This implies that consonant clusters of 3 or more do not exist in Perflontus, that
        initial
        consonants are never clustered, and that whenever two vowels are adjacent there is a syllable break between
        them.
        For purposes of most of the language rules, ' is a consonant that is always a syllable unto
        itself.<sup id="fnref:1">
            <a href="puflantu-guide.html#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a>
            </sup</p> <p>Stress in Perflontus always falls on the vowel preceding a word's final consonant cluster.<sup
                id="fnref:2">
                <a href="puflantu-guide.html#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a>
            </sup> If no such vowel
            exists,
            it falls on the word's first syllable instead.</p>
    <p>Nouns and the things that modify them always end in vowels. Verbs and adverbs<sup id="fnref:3">
            <a href="puflantu-guide.html#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a>
        </sup> always end in consonants. To this
        end
        the suffix -s is frequently used to adverbialize words, including at the end of particles like -li(s) and
        -ka(s).
    </p>
    <p class="design-notes">Design notes: A lot of the details here were nailed down early. The phoneme inventory
        intentionally excludes /θ/ and /ð/, and includes /ɲ/ and /ŋ/, in an effort to sound less English. The bell was
        originally pitched as a funny inclusion for the FAQ ("We'll add 'a bell' to the recommended materials with no
        further explanation") and took a life of its own from there. Early versions of our consonant chart include
        "Manual"
        row as a manner of articulation just for this.</p>
    <h3>Sentence Structure</h3>
    <p>Perflontus is head-final and uses a subject-object-verb (SOV) sentence structure<sup id="fnref:4">
            <a href="puflantu-guide.html#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a>
        </sup>. Commas are used to set off long
        phrases.<sup id="fnref:5">
            <a href="puflantu-guide.html#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a>
        </sup> Taking cues from other SOV languages, we tried to place adverbs between the object and the verb as
        often as
        possible.</p>
    <div class="puflantu-block">
        <p>I eat cookies.</p>
        <p>cookie-PL eat-1S<sup id="fnref:6">
                <a href="puflantu-guide.html#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a>
        </sup></p>
        <p class="puflantu">Torelwe wlwmoc.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The particle -ka(s) is used at the end of verbs to indicate the end of a dependent clause. The role of the
        modified
        word within the dependent clause is indicated by the use of the relative pronouns <span
            class="puflantu">al</span> and <span class="puflantu">ol</span>; the former
        later
        expanded its role to include adverbs used in the dependent clause, e.g. <span class="puflantu">albwr</span> "at
        that time" from <span class="puflantu">al-</span> +
        <span class="puflantu">bwri</span>
        "time". Such an adverb, if it exists, is placed at the beginning of the dependent clause instead of as close to
        the
        verb as possible.</p>
    <div class="puflantu-block">
        <p>I eat when I'm hungry.</p>
        <p>that-time hungry be-1S-DEP-ADV eat-1S</p>
        <p class="puflantu">Albwr ruzeqo zwm-kas wlwmoc.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="design-notes">Design notes: Properly handling dependent clauses was easily the most time-consuming part of
        design, since it's the part of syntax that really lets you build sentences with normal amounts of complexity. (A
        real linguist might say something here about generative grammar.) It's not really obvious how heavily we rely on
        these things until one tries to go without them (including constructs like rephrasing "with X" as "that
        possesses
        X").</p>
    <p class="design-notes">Ultimately the structure I went with is very Englishy, and in a lot of cases -ka(s) can be
        understood as "that" or "which" in a first pass (as opposed to, say, Chinese, which uses a genitive particle to
        mark
        dependent clauses as a property that possesses the modified word). The placement of referring adverbs like
        <span class="puflantu">albwr</span>
        and <span class="puflantu">alhan</span> at the start of dependent clauses happened pretty early and I didn't
        realize it was inconsistent
        with
        our other adverb placement until it was already everywhere. At least it's inconsistent in a systematic way?</p>
    <h3>Verbs</h3>
    <p>Perflontus inflects its verbs in a variety of ways, as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Proclitic particles for tense (future/past), aspect (imperfective/perfective), and mood
            (hypothetical/counterfactual).</li>
        <li> Prefixes for reversal (which is distinct from negation), imperative mood, augmentation, and diminution.
            (The
            latter two also migrated to being valid nounjective prefixes.)</li>
        <li>Up to three infixes for the subject pronoun, negation, and object pronoun, in that order, placed before the
            root
            verb's final vowel.</li>
        <li>Nounjectivifying<sup id="fnref:7">
                <a href="puflantu-guide.html#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a>
        </sup> suffixes for gerund/participle/infinitive (mixing), agent (mixer/mix-capable), patient
            (mixee/mixable), locative (mix-hosting), instrument (mix-enabling), causative (mix-causing), and resultative
            (mixture).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each verb has a root form that is never used alone; one of the last three inflections is always applied. To this
        end
        the root form is formally notated with an asterisk indicating the infix position (e.g. wl*oc), though we ended
        up
        only having one irregular verb where this notation was a useful reminder (to be, az / z*).</p>
    <p>Because verbs necessarily have personal pronouns infixed in them, the pronouns are often elided, except when they
        are
        desired for emphasis or clarity.</p>
    <div class="puflantu-block">
        <p>I eat cookies.</p>
        <p>1S cookie-PL eat-1S</p>
        <p class="puflantu">Wm torelwe wlwmoc.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="puflantu-block">
        <p>cookie-PL eat-1S-3pO</p>
        <p class="puflantu">Torelwe wlwmodoc.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="puflantu-block" style="text-decoration: line-through;">
        <p>1S cookie-PL eat</p>
        <p class="puflantu">Wm torelwe wloc.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="puflantu-block">
        <p>Cookies are eaten.</p>
        <p>cookie-PL eat-3pO</p>
        <p class="puflantu">Torelwe wlodoc.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Two of the verbs (and possibly more) are "reversed" from what an English speaker would expect. This feature is
        borrowed from Spanish, just because. The verbs that appeared in artifacts were som*un "to please" (i.e.
        "gustar")
        and pel*ig "to worry". That is, one says "X pleases me" instead of "I like X", and "X worries me" instead of "I
        worry about X".</p>
    <p>The affixes/clitics are as follows. If multiple affixes with the same position are used, they appear in the order
        listed in the table:</p>

    <h3>Nounjectives</h3>
    <p> Nouns in Perflontus also double as adjectives. For those things that in English would clearly be one or the
        other, it is up to the listener/reader to determine the sense of the corresponding type. For example we used
        <span class="puflantu">furwnwe</span> as "fluffy (plural)" in the Bakeoff but as "clouds" in the "Dumb" lyrics
        clip.</p>
    <p>Nouns take relatively few additional morphemes; the most frequent are the <span class="puflantu">-w</span> and
        <span class="puflantu">-we</span> suffixes, which replace the noun's final vowel when using the dual and plural
        numbers respectively. In addition, nounjectives can be negated by infixing <span class="puflantu">-ay-</span>
        prior to their last vowel, similar to how it's done with verbs.</p>
    <p>The <span class="puflantu">ag-</span>, <span class="puflantu">sa-</span>, and <span class="puflantu">vo-</span>
        prefixes also retain the same meanings as when they are applied to verbs, but their usage on nounjectives is
        more a matter of forming new root words than as generally applicable prefixes.</p>

                <p>The rules surrounding <span class="puflantu">'</span> are a little more complicated than this due to
                    other language rules/constraints, but this is close enough.</p>

            <li class="footnote" id="fn:2">
                <p>This may not have been honored as much in the Artists meta as I'd have liked, since I was more
                    preoccupied with speaking slowly without being completely monotone.</p>

            <li class="footnote" id="fn:3">
                <p>For a very loose definition of "adverb". There are definitely adjective-modifying words that didn't
                    end up getting the adverbial transformation because I felt it would be too confusing.</p>

            <li class="footnote" id="fn:4">
                <p>This was rigidly imposed for a lot of artifact creation but started slipping as our adverbial phrases
                    got longer and more complex (e.g. by allowing those adverbial phrases to come after the verbs they
                    modify, instead of before).</p>

            <li class="footnote" id="fn:5">
                <p>This compensates somewhat for the lack of syntax-marking particles, as in Japanese or Korean. I
                    didn't start doing this much until later in the translation process, when I felt my fundamentals and
                    vision for the language were clear enough that I could afford to be slack in natural ways.</p>

            <li class="footnote" id="fn:6">
                <p>Our translation process made extensive use of <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlinear_gloss">glosses</a>, which represent a sort of
                    halfway translation
                    point where all the syntax of a sentence has been converted to the target language, but none of the
                    vocabulary has. This makes it easier for us to check that grammar is correct without having to
                    memorize the lexicon, and it also allows us to search over glossed text when a word or grammatical
                    feature needs to be replaced. Here the -PL marker stands for "plural", and the -1S stands for "first
                    person subject".</p>
