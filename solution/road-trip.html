<p>Solvers are given a list of travelogue entries. Each entry clues 2 things, one of which is a city. However, the city is underspecified. For example:</p>

<div class="quote">Today we met an archaeologist in a city founded in 1821.
</div>
<p>This clue does not uniquely specify a city. However, solvers will eventually notice that the second thing clued in each entry is named for a state. For example, this entry clues INDIANA JONES, and the only city in Indiana founded in 1821 is Indianapolis. Here is a list of clues and the things they reference:</p>

<p>Notably, these cities are in alphabetical order. This implies we need to reorder. As it happens, there is only one way to traverse these states in <i>Road Trip</i> order - that is, enter each one only once and always exit into the next state. This, combined with flavor suggesting we start in New York and end in Washington, clues the following order:</p>

<img class="center" src="road-trip.png">

<p>So we get the following city order:</p>

<div class="cities">
<p class='city-row'>1. &emsp;<b>R</b>ochester, New York</p>
<p class='city-row'>2. &emsp;<b>E</b>rie, Pennsylvania</p>
<p class='city-row'>3. &emsp;<b>G</b>arfield Heights, Ohio</p>
<p class='city-row'>4. &emsp;<b>I</b>ndianapolis, Indiana</p>
<p class='city-row'>5. &emsp;<b>O</b>wensboro, Kentucky</p>
<p class='city-row'>6. &emsp;<b>N</b>orfolk, Virginia</p>
<p class='city-row'>7. &emsp;<b>A</b>thens, Tennessee</p>
<p class='city-row'>8. &emsp;<b>L</b>aGrange, Georgia</p>
<p class='city-row'>9. &emsp;<b>S</b>elma, Alabama</p>
<p class='city-row'>10.&emsp;<b>T</b>upelo, Mississippi</p>
<p class='city-row'>11.&emsp;<b>O</b>pelousas, Louisiana</p>
<p class='city-row'>12.&emsp;<b>R</b>ound Rock, Texas</p>
<p class='city-row'>13.&emsp;<b>M</b>idwest City, Oklahoma</p>
<p class='city-row'>14.&emsp;<b>E</b>vans, Colorado</p>

<p class='city-row'>16.&emsp;<b>E</b>l Mirage, Arizona</p>
<p class='city-row'>17.&emsp;<b>V</b>entura, California</p>
<p class='city-row'>18.&emsp;<b>E</b>ugene, Oregon</p>
<p class='city-row'>19.&emsp;<b>N</b>ewcastle, Washington</p>
</div>

<p>The clue for the final stop, Newcastle, also mentions an additional hint about the answer:</p>

<div class="quote">Over the course of this journey, we saw a lot of amazing things, but nothing quite as impressive as something we encountered at the very beginning, before we started our trip – can you guess what it is?</div>


<p>Taking in hand the cluephrase spelled by the cities, <tt>REGIONAL STORM ELEVEN</tt>, and the clue that this comes from before New York, we get the answer, <tt><b>NORTHEASTER</b></tt>.</p>

    <h4>Author&rsquo;s Notes</h4>
    <p>This started as a crossword contest idea - I was going to have theme entries like RIP VAN WINKLE or TRIPLE CROWN, and then the four theme entries' related states would spell the answer. Unfortunately, I couldn't come up with any set that had a good answer. At that point, this became a GPH puzzle. I like how it's turned out.</p>

Some clues that didn't make it in for various reasons:
<ul><li>We narrowly avoided being stabbed by a heavy dagger today while in a city formerly known as the "City of Rainbows".</li><li>We met a chicken today in a city in a city whose coordinates are ??&deg;46' N, ??&deg;27' W</li><li>We enjoyed a delicious frozen dessert today on our way to a city associated with a May 2009 wildfire.</li><li>We crossed paths with the Continental army today in a city which was awared a 5-star water quality rating by the NRDC in 2011.</li><li>We watched a performance by a 2000s teen idol today in a city which shares its name with an elite university.</li></ul>
